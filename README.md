# Purpose of the project
The purppose of this project was to understand how to construct a binary tree and generate one using to different methods.

Instead of inputting data one by one, which is still possible with a bit of restructuring, the tree is generated with random numbers as data.

## Methods
1. By Level - The first solution generates a tree by the number of levels the user enters.
2. By Node - The second soltuion generates a tree by the number of nodes the user enters.
